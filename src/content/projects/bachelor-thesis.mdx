# Enhancing Jupyter Notebooks with Multi-Model Database Support

The Bachelor's thesis is a research project at the end of the Bachelor's degree.
I completed it over the course of four months in parallel to other lectures.


## Project Idea
Computational notebooks such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) have become the method of choice for data scientists to explore, analyze and present data.
What remains cumbersome is the retrieval of data from various different data sources.

In this project, I developed a middleware for Jupyter Notebook on the basis of the database system [Polypheny](https://polypheny.com/).
It introduces a new cell type to notebooks, called a `Query Cell`.
This enables users to execute a query on any data stored in Polypheny, using any of the supported query languages (SQL, MongoQL, Cypher and more).
The results shown visually and become accessible to code cells for further analysis and visualization.

To make these novel features accessible, I developed a new notebook interface from the ground up for the browser-based user interface of Polypheny.
Notebooks are executed using a Jupyter Server instance that runs in an automatically deployed Docker container.
