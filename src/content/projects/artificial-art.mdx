In this project in collaboration with [Tobias Hafner](https://github.com/TobiasHafner), we developed a tool that enables audience members of a game show to participate in a vote using their phones.
Results are shown and updated in real time for everyone to see.

## Artificial Art â€“ AI vs. Human Composers
As part of the [Interfinity Festival](https://www.interfinity.ch/) in Basel, the *Artificial Art* game show lets human composers compete against AI compositions across five chapters.
The audience hears two versions per chapter and piece and chooses which piece was AI and which was human.

After both versions are performed by a human ensemble, the audience may use their phones to vote which piece was composed by a human.
The voting results are shown as two rising bars. After the vote is over, the true answer is revealed.

## Voting Tool
The specific requirements on the voting process and presentation required a custom implementation of a suitable tool.
The tool consists of a React frontend and a backend created with Flask.
The frontend is divided into three separate views:

- Voter View: Accessed by scanning a QR-code. Allows participants to submit at most one vote per question.
- Presenter View: Projected to the big screen. Seamlessly animates between different stages of a vote and shows the results as bar plots that update in real time.
- Admin View: Allows authenticated users to register votes, initiate state transitions and reveal the correct answer.

The backend is responsible for efficiently processing and validating votes.
We have evaluated the system performance to ensure that it can handle hundreds of requests per second.
